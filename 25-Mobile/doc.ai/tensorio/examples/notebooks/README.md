## Tensor/IO Examples

Example code demonstrating how to build models for use with tensor/io. Code is versioned by backend. Each model is accompanied by an example tensor/io *model.json* file that shows how to create the *model.json* based on the model's layer names, signature definition, and other named operations in the model.
