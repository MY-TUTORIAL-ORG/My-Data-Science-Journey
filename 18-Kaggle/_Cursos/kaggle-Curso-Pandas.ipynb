Pandas has three core methods for doing this. In order of increasing complexity, these are concat(), join(), and merge(). Most of what merge() can do can also be done more simply with join(), so we will omit it and focus on the first two functions here.\n","\n","The simplest combining method is concat(). Given a list of elements, this function will smush those elements together along an axis.\n","\n","This is useful when we have data in different DataFrame or Series objects but having the same fields (columns). One example: the YouTube Videos dataset, which splits the data up based on country of origin (e.g. Canada and the UK, in this example). If we want to study multiple countries simultaneously, we can use concat() to smush them together:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"26xBYy7DWKSs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638368262430,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":823,"user":{"displayName":"Andre Vianna","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhUyO9ix5UCW1O7jurSYSmVcE-KWpYoXQbefeV_Mg=s64","userId":"15262904803709800520"}}},"source":["#canadian_youtube = pd.read_csv(\"../input/youtube-new/CAvideos.csv\")\n","#british_youtube = pd.read_csv(\"../input/youtube-new/GBvideos.csv\")\n","\n","#pd.concat([canadian_youtube, british_youtube])"],"execution_count":63,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CX794ZpPW8IN"},"source":["#Exercise"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bUVZS8cOW-G9"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
